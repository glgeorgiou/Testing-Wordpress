<h2>About this repo </h2>
<p>
The aim of this repo is to use an online Wordpress installation in which test cases will be executed according to the documentation that is located in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">formal Wordpress site</a>. Althouth there is community related to the Word
 </p>
 <p>
 Based on the Wordpress documentation and my experience in this CMS, i'll make test plans and execute test cases mainly in black box testing. For each Wordpress version i'll make a separate folder and a specific test plan and test scenarios. I'm planning to do <strong>manual</strong> and <strong>automated</strong> tests. As far as the automated test is concerned will be based on:
 <ul>
 <li>Selenium</li>
 <li>Cypress</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p>Stay tuned.</p>
